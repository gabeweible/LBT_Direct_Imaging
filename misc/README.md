# IDL_misc
Miscellaneous IDL procedures that may be useful for astronomical research (incl. direct imaging), but are not included in the IDL Astronomy User's Library (ASTROLIB).

None of these procedures were authored by me, though I have edited some of them to work as needed for my direct imaging pipeline. Authorship (if available) should be at the beginning of each procedure.
