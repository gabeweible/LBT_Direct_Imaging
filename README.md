# LBT_Direct_Imaging_Pipeline
Various IDL procedures as part of a direct imaging data reduction and analysis pipeline. This pipeline is based off of work by Profs. Kevin Wagner and Daniel Apai of Steward Observatory, but has been heavily modified, refactored, and extended to fit my work. This is a work-in-progress and not intended to be a standalone package.
